c.2) According to Cynefin framework, what are five problem domains? Which
problem domain(s) is Scrum particularly well suited for?

    The Cynefin framework categorizes problem domain into four types:
        - Simple
        - Complicated
        - Complex
        - Chaotic

    Scrum is well suited for complex problem domains. Scrum is an agile
methodology that emphasises on flexibility, collaboration, and continuous
improvement. It encourrages the team to learn through a seriec of sprints and
to adjust their approach as needed. This method works well for complex problems
in which the relationships between causes and effects are unclear and solutions
emerge through experimentation and learning.
